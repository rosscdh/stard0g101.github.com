<h3>Q: yield</h3>
<ul>
<li>missed answer :( </li>
</ul>
<h3>Q: Assert</h3>
<p><strong> Q </strong> assert is a std python statment but largly unused; as it changes the behaviour in unpredicatble ways
<strong> A </strong> False: assert is used by Guido and others very often and does not indeed change behaviour. Test your code with -o; but even if -o did not exist Guido would still claim that assert is valuable even if underused. if assert tests false it means that the post assert code is not evaluated. If that was replaced by fucntion then both arguments are evaluated even if you dont call the function; python 3 should hav ehad a better implementation; Guido regrets that.</p>
<h3>Q: Does Python has a future in mobile</h3>
<p><strong> A </strong> yes, but Guido will probably not take part in that</p>
<h3>Q: Do you regret including X feature in P3k</h3>
<p><strong> A </strong> unanswerable silly question, sorry to be hostile.</p>
<h3>Q: Question about immutable function signatures</h3>
<p><strong> A </strong> 3 unrelated segments to the question; got a little heated but meh (audience member "the questioner" probably joined in and had to clarify and kinda got handed back)</p>
<h3>Q: Second most favourite language after python</h3>
<p><strong> A </strong> C... because CPython is C</p>
<h3>Q: Where do you see python in 10-20 years</h3>
<p><strong> A </strong> another essay question; python will be alive and happy and probably have grandkids. In general python will continue to be successful. Many of the current head banger issues (GIL,static analysis) etc eventually some version of acceptance or a solution will be absorbed into the language. Pretty optimistic about the future</p>
<h3>Q: Can you identify practices or types of character that makes a good python/programmer</h3>
<p><strong> A </strong> no yes men; this is valued more than absolute approval. Nothing absolute tho... your either adept or not and this shows in the way you are not what you wear or put on your resume... but if you love to code.. it shows.</p>
<h3>Q: What is the best way to profile and catch memory leaks on google servers</h3>
<p><strong> A </strong> Great question, dont really have an answer; blanking out of names.. but they exist and only run in the sdk. run the sdk with an existing memory profiler</p>
<h3>Q: Another daft question about javascript and callbacks</h3>
<p><strong> A </strong> LOL.. meh when your food smells bad.. its probably bad.. most get a weird feeling when writing callbacks and is generally regarded as bad bad bad.. its just js programmers that disagree.</p>
<h3>Q: Why is it "None"</h3>
<p><strong> A </strong> when writing python all other options felt unnatural (nil,no,etc) None just felt natural; and unassertive.. None is a uniquely python thing</p>
<h3>Q: Does pyhton need more innovation for the massivly multicore future?</h3>
<p><strong> A </strong> suspects that by the time we have massivly multicore systems then the concept of shared memory space will be non-applicable. Innovation is useful but it will be a long time before innovation has reached an acceptable model that woudl be worth including in the language. Innocation is not simply including things .. its about langauge complete then looking at incorporation.</p>
<h3>Q: Status of WSGI std in p3k</h3>
<p><strong> A </strong> thought about redesigning p3k to incorporate WSGI but not enough people were interested. As a result wsgi made a small change that made python syntax possible. And thats where WSGI1 stands.</p>
<h3>Q: given virtualenv GAE seems a step back for python</h3>
<p><strong> A </strong> cant answer that needs to ask google as its them.. lol was answered by the moderator ;)</p>
<h3>Q: whats another language like python that is simple and awesome</h3>
<p><strong> A </strong> look at GO its python flavoured and seems good</p>
<h3>Q: In ruby acceptance tests are almost universally written in cucumber why not a python version</h3>
<p><strong> A </strong> go to stack overflow cucmbers lettuce etc are verbs and nouns to him. Aceptance tests are explained to the audiance.. seems quite a new concept BDD is relatively new and customer oriented. </p>
<h3>Q: for p3k would you take a patch for import print form _past</h3>
<p><strong> A </strong> No, despite laughter; print is something that is a syntactic sugar its one of the few cases where you dont have to think about translation and you can leave it to the tool. </p>
<h3>Q: Can I submit a switch statement patch</h3>
<p><strong> A </strong> its been rejected at PEP twice.. it will probably be rejected at PEP again.. the decision was made to keep python clean and simple. Future code maintainers will thank us for removing this feature its ugly and nasty.</p>
<h3>Q: why is there a literal for every single set but the empty one?</h3>
<p><strong> A </strong> there are allot of people that should read the PEP before asking questions.</p>
